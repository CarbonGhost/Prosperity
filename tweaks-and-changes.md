These mods were chosen to improve the gameplay without sacrificing the vanilla feel of the game.

  [[Carpet Extra - updateSuppressionCrashFix]](https://github.com/gnembon/carpet-extra#updatesuppressioncrashfix)

### Item Changes

Various changes to enchanting have been made. I decided to make these changes because I believe that the player should have the option to be overpowered, especially since the server doesn't have a strong focus on PvP and competition.

-   **Armor enchantments can now be mixed**

    Different armor enchantments can now be put on the same piece of armor, for example, blast protection, fire protection, and normal protection can be put on one piece of armor.

You can paste this into your world's `carpet.conf` file, or the `carpet.conf` file found in the `config/carpet` folder on a server. If more configurations files are relevant let me know!
